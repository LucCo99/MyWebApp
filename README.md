## Overview
The Ticket System Web Application is designed to streamline issue resolution and communication by facilitating the creation, management, and tracking of support tickets. It aims to reduce response times and improve operational efficiency by ensuring that issues are promptly addressed and resolved.The Ticket System Web Application leverages cloud technology, specifically Amazon EC2, to provide a scalable and efficient solution for managing support tickets. By harnessing the power of cloud infrastructure, the application ensures high availability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

Advantages of Cloud Hosting (Amazon EC2):

Scalability: Amazon EC2 allows the application to scale seamlessly based on demand. This ensures that the ticket system can handle fluctuations in user traffic without experiencing downtime or performance issues.

Reliability: Cloud infrastructure provides built-in redundancy and failover capabilities, enhancing the reliability of the application. This minimizes the risk of service disruptions and ensures uninterrupted access to support services.

Flexibility: With Amazon EC2, the application can be easily deployed and configured to meet changing business requirements. This flexibility enables rapid deployment of updates, new features, and enhancements to improve the user experience.

Cost-Effectiveness: Cloud hosting offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing organizations to optimize costs by only paying for the resources they use. This eliminates the need for upfront hardware investments and reduces operational expenses.

Solution for Internal Hosting:

While cloud hosting provides numerous benefits, organizations may have specific requirements or constraints that necessitate hosting the application internally. To accommodate such scenarios, the Ticket System Web Application can be deployed on an internal infrastructure using virtualization technologies like VMware or Hyper-V.

Advantages of Internal Hosting:

Data Control: Hosting the application internally provides organizations with greater control over their data and infrastructure. This can be particularly important for organizations with stringent security or compliance requirements.

Performance Optimization: Internal hosting allows organizations to optimize performance by fine-tuning the infrastructure to suit their specific needs. This can result in improved response times and overall system performance.

Cost Savings: In some cases, hosting the application internally may offer cost savings compared to cloud hosting, especially for organizations with existing infrastructure and resources.

By offering both cloud-based and internally-hosted deployment options, the Ticket System Web Application ensures flexibility and adaptability to meet the diverse needs of organizations while delivering efficient support ticket management solutions.
